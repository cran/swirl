text,"Hi, welcome to swirl! Today, we're going to store some numbers in a vector, then take the mean of those numbers. I'm assuming you've already learned how to create variables and call functions.",,,,,,
cmd_question,"First, create a vector of numbers using the c() function and store that vector in a variable of your choice.",command,,assign; newVar; useFunc=c,newVar <- c(1:4),Type ?c to view the help file for the c() function.,
cmd_question,Now compute the mean of these numbers by calling the mean() function on your new vector.,command,,useFunc=mean; result=mean(newVar),mean(newVar),Type ?mean to view the help file for the mean() function.,
mult_question,Which function in R computes the mean of a bunch of numbers?,multiple,median(); mean(); average(),word=mean(),,This one should be obvious!,
video,"Would you like to view a brief YouTube video on how to compute the mean, median, and mode by hand?",,,,,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3aKKasOmIw
text,Great work! Now you know how to compute the mean of a bunch of numbers in R.,,,,,,
